## Acknowledgments 

- [clip-to-psd](https://github.com/dobrokot/clip_to_psd) - Most of the parsing information and logic comes from this project.
- [cliputils](https://github.com/rasensuihei/cliputils) - Having something to easily split the clip file was very helpful

Please if you have specification documents on .clip format, forward them to me, please.
